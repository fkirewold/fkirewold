## About Me

I am a **Full Stack Mobile Developer** focused on building secure, scalable, and maintainable applications from frontend to backend.

I specialize in developing cross-platform mobile apps with Flutter and designing robust backend systems using Node.js and Express.

I follow clean architecture principles and apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) when building real-world systems.

My goal is to create applications that are:
- Secure by design  
- Scalable in production  
- Clean and maintainable  
- Performance-optimized
